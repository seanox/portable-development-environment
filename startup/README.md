# Startup
Startup is a simple background launcher for batch scripts.

The program expects in the current working directory or in the program
directory a batch file of the same name with the file extension cmd that it
starts with a minimized console window and then waits until the end of the
batch script.

If the startup program is renamed, this also affects the name of the expected
batch script.

Arguments are also supported and passed to the batch script.


# System Requirement
- Windows 10 or higher
- .NET 4.7.x or higher


# Download
