# Launcher
A portable program launcher specially developed for the Seanox Virtual
Environment with a full-screen tile look that can also be used standalone and
independently.


# Features
- Full screen overlay interface  
  The tile user interface is displayed as a full screen overlay on the primary
  screen.
- Tile user interface  
  User interface with 40 freely configurable tiles.
- Global HotKey combination  
  A global HotKey combination is used to show and hide the tile user interface.
- HotKey for tiles and programs  
  Quick access via the keyboard, optimized for the used keyboard layout.  
  Support for international keyboard layouts.
- Automatic settings update  
  Changes in the settings are used immediately, if the settings are incorrect
  the last settings are kept.
- Settings supports environment variables  
  Environment variables can be used in text-based values.
- Visual style per settings (themes support)  
  The interface supports the configuration of colors, opacity, background color  
  and image, and the appearance of the grid.
- No icons and functions in the taskbar or system tray  
  The program is optimized for the virtual environment. So that the shell is
  not lost, the program is always present in the background and cannot be
  simply terminated.  
- Portable application without installation


# System Requirement
- Windows 10 or higher
- .NET 4.7.x or higher


# Download
The launcher is [part of the virtual environment](https://github.com/seanox/virtual-environment/tree/main/platform/Program%20Portables/Launcher)
but can also be downloaded and used separately.

# Settings
For configuration the file `launcher.xml` (depending on the application name)
in the working directory is used. If this file does not exist or is incorrect,
the launcher aborts the start with an error message.

Example of a configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<settings>
    <!--
